        <h2>Submit your proposal that includes an abstract, details, and pitch</h2>
        <p><strong>Abstract</strong> will be included on the website program.
        This is for audience and includes a high-level overview of the talk.
        This section is limited to 600 characters.</p>

        <p><strong>Details</strong> section gives us more insight into the talk. Please
        include an outline of the talk, any demonstrations that you plan on
        doing, etc. This will not be public if your talk is accepted,
        allowing edits within reason until the day of the talk.
        No character limitation.</p>

        <p><strong>Pitch</strong> section is where we want to hear about
        why you think this talk is important. What makes you excited about
        this topic? Why does the audience need to hear about this?</p>

        <h2>How it works</h2>

        <p>You can edit your proposal after submission. Please submit your
        proposal as early as possible to allow us to provide feedback if
        necessary. Everything is considered a draft until the call for
        proposals closes. Not all submissions will receive feedback.

        <p>The first few rounds of the process are blind. During the blind
        process, we will only see the following information:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>The title of your talk</li>
            <li>The abstract that will be shown to the public if your talk is accepted</li>
            <li>The details you provide about the content and flow of your talk</li>
            <li>The pitch you provide speaking to why it's important</li>
            <li>The date and time your proposal was first submitted</li>
            <li>The date and time you last updated your proposal</li>
        </ul>

        <p>To help us with the blind process, please do not include any
        identifying information in your proposals or in any of the comments.
        Please respect this process.</p>

        <p>The entire process will be blind until we have reviewed and rated
        every single proposal. After the call for proposals closes, we'll
        tally up the ratings and do our final selection based on all of the
        information you provided in the proposal. We will then proceed with
        a full review of the speaker profile to make sure there is no
        unintentional bias and skew in our selection process. We want
        to select the best topics for our View Source audience.</p>

        <p>If your talk is selected, you'll receive:
        <ul>
            <li>A free ticket for you and your companion to the conference</li>
            <li>An invitation to the speakers’ meetup</li>
            <li>Travel stipend to and from the conference</li>
            <li>A two-night accomodation</li>
        </ul>

        <p>If you've already purchased a ticket by the time you are
        selected as a speaker, we will refund your purchase completely—so,
        don't wait to buy a ticket. Also, if your company or employer is able
        to cover your travel and lodging, we'll happily list them as a
        speaker sponsor on our conference website.</p>

        <p>View Source abides by our <a href="{{ conference_data.folder }}/code_of_conduct">Code of Conduct</a> and
        expects all speakers and attendees to do the same.</p>
