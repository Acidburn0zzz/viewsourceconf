<p>Let&rsquo;s come together to view the source of the modern Web, build the Web we want, and explore the best ways to apply emerging Web technologies today.</p>

<p>View Source is an event by developers, for developers, with emphasis on exposing best practices and practical development techniques. Sessions will dive into the code, analyze the web experience across browsers and devices, explore ready-to-use new technologies, and share best practices for improving how modern websites and applications are built.</p>

<p>Since communication encourages innovation &mdash; and makes things more fun &mdash; facilitated, interactive discussions will encourage group conversations between attendees, speakers, and subject matter experts on a range of topics. Showcased demos will focus on products that help developers create powerful, convenient, and easy-to-use apps and websites with a minimum of frustration and headache.</p>
