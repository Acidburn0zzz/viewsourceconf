But in reality, starting from scratch is simply not practical or possible for many (or even most) projects. So what can we do to overcome some of the most common obstacles and still get to that elusive, mobile-first, responsive site? In this talk, I’ll go behind the scenes through the nitty-gritty of a real world responsive retrofitting project, and provide useful tips that can be put in practice by other teams facing similar challenges."
