Docker makes it easy to create consistent development environments, which means it's easier for you to manage application dependencies, share code with your team, and get up and running with new applications quickly. We'll look at tools in the Docker ecosystem designed specifically with developers in mind, like Docker Compose and Docker for Mac and Windows. You'll learn how to get a Docker development environment set up on your own machine, and get to know the tools and processes needed to create your own containerized web applications with Docker, regardless of the language or framework you prefer.",
